FFmpegthumbnailer is a lightweight video thumbnailer that can be used by file
managers to create thumbnails for your video files. The thumbnailer uses ffmpeg
o decode frames from the video files, so supported videoformats depend on the
configuration flags of ffmpeg.

This thumbnailer was designed to be as fast and lightweight as possible. The
only dependencies are ffmpeg and libpng.

This is the 2.0.9 sources from https://code.google.com/p/ffmpegthumbnailer packaged 
into a release so it can be used in http://ignorantguru.github.io/spacefm for
http://alpinelinux.org (& perhaps be useful for other distributions).
